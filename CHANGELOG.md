## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Renamed the default agent from "Ada" to "Anita"** (#151) to match the
  `anita` CLI. This touches the agent display name, the spawned CLI command,
  user-facing labels, prompts, logs, and docs. The canonical provider id is now
  `anita`.

  **Backward compatibility:** the legacy `ada` provider id is still accepted on
  read. Existing sessions that persisted `provider: "ada"` (or omitted it),
  agent settings saved under the `ada` key, and API requests using
  `?provider=ada` continue to work — they resolve to `anita` automatically, so
  no migration is required. Skills are read from the canonical
  `~/.anita/skills` / `.anita/skills` locations, falling back to the legacy
  `~/.ada/skills` / `.ada/skills` locations when the new ones don't exist yet.
